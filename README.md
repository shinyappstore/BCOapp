# BCOapp: Generate BioCompute Objects from Workflows

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/BCOapp](https://shinyappstore.com/a/BCOapp)__

The Seven Bridges BCO App offers a suite of tools for creating and working with BioCompute Objects (BCOs). With this app, users can generate BCOs from various inputs, including user text input, workflows written in Common Workflow Language (CWL), and CWL/task information generated on the Cancer Genomics Cloud. Additionally, the BCO App provides features for reviewing and validating BCOs. This updated version of the app builds upon our initial prototype developed for the precisionFDA BioCompute Object Challenge. The overall goal of the BioCompute Object standard is to streamline the communication of Next Generation Sequencing Analyses by establishing a structured approach for conveying complex analyses commonly encountered in bioinformatics and precision medicine applications. See the BioCompute Object webpage for additional information (https://biocomputeobject.org).
